Overview
This project contains two FastAPI applications:

1. Task Management API (fastapi-curd.py)
Implements basic CRUD operations to manage tasks.

Each task includes the following attributes:

id: Unique UUID identifier

title: Task title

description: Optional task description

completed: Boolean flag indicating if the task is completed

2. User Authentication API (fastapi-tutorial.py)
Implements user registration, login, and token-based authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

Secures endpoints and stores user data in a simulated database.

Requirements and Installation
Make sure you have a recent version of Python installed.

Install the required packages using pip:

css

Notes
The authentication API uses the python-jose library for encoding and decoding JWT tokens.

The python-multipart package is required to handle form data in login requests.
